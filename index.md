## Introduction
### ISIMIP: General concept
ISIMIP provides a framework for the collation of a consistent set of climate impact data across sectors and scales. This framework will s erve as a
basis for model evaluation and improvement, allowing for improved estimates of the biophysical and socio-economic impacts of climate change at
different levels of global warming. It also provides a unique opportunity for considering interactions between climate change impacts across
sectors through consistent scenarios.
ISIMIP is intended to be structured in successive rounds, each having its own focus topics (see section 2.1) and focus regions (see section 2.2) that
inform the scenario design. The main components of the ISIMIP framework are:
* A common set of climate and other input data which will be distributed via a central database;
* A common modelling protocol to ensure consistency across sectors and scales in terms of data, format and scenario set-up;
* A central archive where the output data will be collected and made available to the scientific community.

### General remark regarding adaptation
As in the ISIMIP Fast Track, simulations should not be designed to describe the effects of different adaptation measures. In contrast, it is the aim to
describe the impacts of climate change on different s ectors under “present-day” management assumptions. There are individual exceptions to this
general rule (such as “naturalized” runs within the water sector). These exceptions are clearly specified in the sector-specific scenario set-up of the
simulations (see Chapter 7). Wherever such an exception is not mentioned please choose the "present day" option regarding management.
In particular, the historical validation runs should be "as close to the real historic conditions as possible" (i.e. to the extent to which this can be
achieved without major model improvement)


## General Design of ISIMIP2a
### Focus topic
"Extreme events and variability" was chosen as the focus topic of ISIMIP2a, reflecting the interest of the community as well as stakeholders in
investigating and improving the representation of variability and extreme events, in particular in impact models and along the entire modelling
chain. Therefore, the model evaluation and validation task specified in this protocol is explicitly designed to evaluate the models’ ability to
reproduce observed historical variability, responses to extreme climatic events such as heat waves, droughts, floods, heavy rains and storms, and
representation of extreme impact events (ISIMIP2 A see section 2.3).
Based on these evaluation exercises, modelling teams will have the opportunity to adjust model parameters, and implement necessary model
improvements. As a next step (see the ISIMIP2b protocol), future projections will be performed using these improved impact model s ettings. To
this end it is also intended to implement an improved bias correction method, which better preserves variability and extreme events, and to apply
this method to the RCP climate projections. This exercise will also make it possible to estimate the extent of impacts that are not captured, or
possibly over- or underestimated, in already-available impact projections from the Fast Track using the original model settings.
Note that the emphasis on this focus topic does not exclude some other work not directly related to extreme events and variability. For example,
in particular for regional models and in new sectors, it may be important to first calibrate and investigate performance for average condition.

## Focus regions
While only global impact models participated in the ISIMIP Fas t Track, ISIMIP2 will bring together both global and regional modelling groups. A
common set of focus regions will allow for a comparison between global and regional (i.e. sub-global) models, as well as an integration of regional
impacts from different sectors. It was developed together with participants prior to and during the side event of the Impacts World 2013
conference. Figure 1 shows the set of focus regions.
This first selection represents a compromise between maximis ing coverage of climatic, environmental and cultural zones, and keeping the associated workload feasible. The set of regions may be extended to cover new regions that are highly relevant with regard to climate change
impacts but are currently under researched, or to accommodate new sectors. It may also be extended to include regions of specific interest to
individual sectors, such as is already indicated by the dashed boxes in Figure 1, which are particularly relevant for the regional forest and water
modellers. Participants working with (regional) marine ecosystem and fishery models are encouraged to focus on coastal regions adjacent to
selected river basins (e.g. Rhine – North Sea; Mississippi – Gulf of Mexico; etc.).
All participants running regional models are asked to set up and run their models for as large a part of each focus region as possible, in order to
obtain maximal spatial overlap with other models.

## Motivation of experiment design
This chapter provides a short description of the scientific rationale behind the design of each of the experiments in ISIMIP2a. The details of the
experiments are further described in the remainder of the protocol.
The overarching objective of the historical validation experiment is to gain insight into the ability of current impact models to reproduce observed
features of simulated variables, with an emphas is on (but not limited to) variability and extreme events. Simulations are designed such as to match
historical conditions as closely as possible, within the limitations of e.g. availability of his torical forcing data, variety of model formulations, and
model development resources.
Conducting such an experiment within ISIMIP can facilitate a cross-sectoral synthesis of state-of-the-art modelling skills and help identify key
opportunities for model improvement efforts. Examples of res earch questions that could be addressed include: How good is the current
generation of impact models at reproducing the observed response to a certain climatic event (e.g. the Russian heat wave in 2010) across
different sectors? What are the historic extreme events that are “extreme” across different sectors and are they reproduced by the different
model types? Can yield losses in certain regions only be reproduced by accounting for the limited availability of irrigation water? In addition to the
conventional, standardized validation exercises one could also look at the simultaneous effects of e.g. ENSO, as a major climatic driving force,
across the various sectors, and compare with observations. One could also calculate drought indices from the water model results and test the
influence of those droughts e.g. on yields. Another interesting question is the spatial and temporal coherence/concurrence of impacts in different
sectors.
Four different observations-based historical climate datasets will be used to force impact models, to allow for a comparison of the different
historical simulations. Each data set has its own strengths and weaknes ses (e.g. regarding temporal extent, quality of particular variables, previous
application within the modeling community) and generally represents a plausible reconstruction of the terrestrial climate of the past approx. 100 years.
The different historical simulations will allow a systematic quantification of the effect of the choice of forcing data on impact model results; allow
comparison to previous studies using either of these datasets; and provide an extensive data base for model evaluation and impact assessment, in
particular with regard to the focus topic (e.g. a certain climatic extreme event could be better reproduced in one data set than in the other).
Note that one important criterion for the selection of climate forcing datasets was their temporal extent. Biomes models in particular need long
spin-up, therefore it is crucial that the datasets cover a substantial extent of time before the start of the reporting period. Also, note that the
GSWP3 (Global Soil Wetness Project 3) data set was only recently developed and a description paper is not yet available. This dataset is based on
dynamical downscaling and thereby promises rather good quality in particular with regard to the resolution of the variability. A short description of
the main characteristics of this dataset will be distributed by email and is also available upon request. Further details on the global dynamical
downscaling method are given in ref (Yoshimura & Kanamitsu, 2008, 2013).
